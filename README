From wikipedia:
Ananse the trickster is a spider, and is one of the most important 
characters of West African and Caribbean folklore.

But:
Ananse names a net spider environment

It is a mono program that:

o  is highly dynamic (using Reflection) to inspect objects
o  interactivly follow (crawl)  properties 
o  records the pathes involved
o  generalises the patterns in such a crawl 
o  generates datamodels and codes while doing so

it is the ultimative trickster. Well it will be after this last sentence was 
removed from the README.
